# Propagation and Antenna
## Chapter 3
### Horn Antenna
####  Features
- Antenna with the shape of horn
- one end of waveguide is flared out
- hollow metallic tube, combined with horn
- when the waveguide is excited at one end, and open at second end
- for matching between the waveguide and free space, added flared waveguide (horn)

- radiation efficiency, gain and directivity will be improved
- wave into a gradual transformation from waveguide to forward direction: termed as flaring, its horn antenna
- horn can be used for either antenna itself or feeder for reflector
- flare angle decides the directivity and radiation beam

- operational frequency range of a horn antenna is around 300 MHz to 30GHz
- uhf, shf, and ehf range
- higher frequencies as high as 140 GHz
- regional, global and hemispherical beams
- microwave antenna

- excited in any polarization
- or excited in combination of polarization
- purity of polarization is possible
- radiation: unidirectional pattern
- horns are used for measuring laboratory standards

#### Types
##### 1. Pyramidal Horn
- flaring on both the E & H walls of a rectangular waveguide
- shape of truncated pyramid
- used in lab experiments
- used as feeder
- widely used as standard horn
- it can radiate cross-polarization free waves
- gain can be precisely calculated from its physical dimension
- even for measuring gain of a large aperture antenna
- it radiates linearly polarized radio waves
- flare angle ($\theta$)= $$2\cos^{-1}\left(\dfrac{L}{L+\delta}\right)$$
##### 2. Sectoral Horn
- flares out in only one direction
- flaring in the direction of electric vector produces the sectoral E-plane horn
- similarly for H-plane horn
- produces fan shaped beam
- narrow in the plane of flared sides
- wide in the plane of the narrow sides
- used as feed horns for wide search radar antennas
##### 3. Conical Horn
- circular waveguide is flared
- logical termination of circular waveguide
- flaring helps to match the antenna impedance
- free space impedance 377 $\Omega$ for better radiation
- avoids SWR
- provides greater directivity and narrower beamwidth
- flared waveguide can be technically termed as EM Horn radiator
- flare angle is an important factor
- too small -> resulting wave will be spherical instead of plane
	- radiated beam will not be directive
- should have optimum value
- closely related to its length
- horn with a circular cross section.
### Reflector Antenna
- mostly aperture antennas are microwave antenna
- parabolic reflector are microwave antenna
- referred to as dish antenna
- frequency range
	- the frequency range used for the application of parabolic reflector is above 1 GHz.
