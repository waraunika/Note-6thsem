## Convolutional Code for Error correction
- $$\int_{}^{} x_1(t)\ \star\ x_2(t+\lambda)\ dt $$

### Code Tree based
1. Encoder
2. Decoder
	- So called sequential decoder
3. Process:
	- State diagram ->
	- based ->
	- a) Trellis Diagram based encoder
	- b) Trellis based decoder called viterbi Decoder
