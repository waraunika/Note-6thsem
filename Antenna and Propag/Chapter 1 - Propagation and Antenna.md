## **Input Impedance**
- Impedance Presented by Antenna at itsTerminals 
- Ratio of Voltage to Current at a Terminals 
- Ratio of Appropriate Components of Electric to Magnetic Fields at a Point Impedance 
- Measured at a pair of Terminals 
	-i.e. Input Terminals of Antenna
- Measured as:
	Zin= RA + jXA
	Where, 
		ZA is Antenna Impedance at Terminals a-b 
		RA is Antenna Resistance at Terminals a-b 
		XA is Antenna Reactance at Terminals a-b 
	And, RA = Rr + RL
		Rr = Radiation Resistance of the Antenna 
		RL = Loss Resistance of the Antenna

### Radiation Resistance

- Equiv to Same Amount of Power When actually Radiating 
- Not actually Measured Resistance from Antenna
- Rr is Subject to the power that it converts into EMW
- Ratio of power radiated to square of current at feed point
- Radiation Resistance 
- Radiating Antenna Power (P) = ![[Pasted image 20260112150236.png]]
- Radiation Resistance (Rr)  for Half Wave Dipole

## **Antenna Theorems**
### Reciprocity (2)(3)
- Mostly an Antenna Performs Transmission as well as Reception
- Same Antenna can be Used for both Functions
- Va = Vb and Ia = Ib
- ![[Pasted image 20260112153711.png]]
### Superposition (2)(3)
- Applicable to only Linear Networks
- Current is Linearly Related to Voltage
- That is as per Ohm’s Law
- Current flowing at any Point = Sum of Currents that would flow if each Generator were Considered Separately
- All other Generators being Replaced at time by Impedance Equal to their int. Impedances
- Field Intensity at a Point due to no. of Tx Antennas = Vector sum of Field Intensities due to each of Antennas
- One side a Rx antenna and Other side no. of Tx antennas
- Conditions:
	- Same type of Antennas
	- Same Frequency Bands
	- Directional Antennas
	- Rx Antenna is within the Far Field Regions of Tx Antennas
---
### Thevenin (3)
- Terminal Volt A and B (of Generator) can be Replaced by 
	- Single Voltage Source, VTH 
	- In Series with a Single Resistance RTH.
- Tx and Rx antennas systems -> Equiv to Generator and Load Equivalent
- Thevenin Theorem can be Applied in Both cases 
- Any linear Bilateral Network may be Reduced to a Simplified Two-terminal Circuit consisting of 
	- Single Voltage Source 
	- In Series with a Single Resistor

### Maximum Power Transfer (2)(3)
	- Superposition Vs Max Power Transfer +Fig (3+3)

- Maximum Power Transfer can be Possible. 
- Maximum Power can be Transferred when
		Zg = Z0 = Za
	Where,
	Zg = Generator Impedance
	Z0 = Characteristic Impedance of TX line 
	Za = Antenna I/p Impedance
- An Impedance Connected to 2 Terminals of a Netw -> Absorbs Max Power from Netw when 
	- Z = Conjugate of Z
	- i.e. seen Looking back into Netw from 2 Terminals
- Max. Power can be Absorbed from Network
	- $V^2_{oc}/4R$
	- Voc = Open Circuit V at O/P Terminals 
	- R = Resistive Component of Impedance Looking back from O/P Terminals
- Determines $Z_L$ -> Result in MPT across Terminals of an Active circuit (Netw)
- For MPT
	- $Z_L$ = Complex Conjugate of Source Z = $Z_S$ 
		RL+jxL = RS+jxS 
		RL = RS
		xL = - xS
---
### Compensation / Substitution Theorem (2)(3)
- Any Z in Netw may be Replaced by a Generator with 0 $Z_{Int}$ 
	- Whose Gen V at Every Instant = Instantaneous PD 
	- Exists across Z because of Current Flowing through it.
- Netw Impedance, Z may be Replaced by a Compensating Voltage
	- Where Magnitude and Phase of Source = I Z.
- Note : I and V in all other parts of Netw remains Unchanged after Substituting Compensation Source
---
### **Equality of Directional Patterns**
- Directional & Radiation Pattern of Receiving Antenna -> Identical as Transmitting Antenna
- This method is used for Designing Antennas
- Very Effective for Measurement of Antenna Parameters
- Fig: Two (Tx & Rx) Antennas Separated by a Distance R
	- ![[Pasted image 20260113121847.png]]
