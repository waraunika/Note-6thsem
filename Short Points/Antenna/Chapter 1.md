# 1.1 Retarded Potential
- Definition:
	- Retarded potential is the mathematical solution to Maxwell's wave equations that accounts for the finite speed of propagation of EM waves from sources to observation points.
- Concept:
	- unlike static potentials where changes are instantaneous, retarded potentials incorporate the time delay required delay for EM wave to travel through space.
- Retarded Time:
	- time at which the EM wave must have been emitted to arrive at the observation point at the current time t.
		- t$_r$ = t - $\dfrac{R}{c}$
- Importance of Retarded Potential:
	1. Clarifies radiation mechanism, and how time-varying currents produce radiation that propagates at finite speed
	2. Far field calculation by simplifying radiation integrals for prediction
	3. Accounts for Time-Delay effects that are essential for analyzing transient radiation, pulsed antenna and broadband performance
	4. Array Antenna Design by controlling delay in beam forming and steering the beam.
	5. Impedance and Mutual coupling between antenna elements depend on retarded interactions
	6. Numerical modeling for simulating real word potential integrals.
## 1.1.A Fields of a short dipole
- for calculation of retarded potential
- I = dq/dt
- I = Io * e (jwt)
- I = Io * e(jw (t - r/c) )
- retarded vector potential (magnetic)
	- Az = ($\micro_0$ / 4pi) $\int$ I/s dz
	- $\dfrac{\micro_0 L I_0 e^{j\omega (t - \frac{r}{c})}}{4\pi r}$
	- this represents vector potential everywhere due to a short dipole.
	- conditions:
		- r >> L
		- $\lambda$ >> L
- retarded scalar potential V (electric)
	- V = 1/4$\pi\ \epsilon_0$ $\int_v$ $\rho$/s d$\tau$
	- V = 1/4$\pi\ \epsilon_0$ (q/s1 - q/s2)
	- q = $\int$ I dt = I / jw
	- same equation, put this value
	- condition:
		- s1 = r - L/2 cos(theta)
		- s2 = r + L/2 cos(theta)
	- V =$$\dfrac{I_0e^{j\omega(t-r/c)}}{4\pi\epsilon_0\ j\omega}*\left[ e^{j(\omega L/2C) * \cos(\theta)} \left( r + \frac{L}{2} \cos(\theta)\right) - e^{-j(\omega L/2C) * \cos(\theta)} \left( r - \frac{L}{2} \cos(\theta)\right) \right]$$
	- convert e$^{jw}$ into cos(w) + j sin(w), then have:
	- condition:
		- $\lambda$ >> L, then
	- $\cos\left(\dfrac{\omega L \cos(\theta)}{2C}\right) = \cos\left(\dfrac{\pi L \cos(\theta)}{\lambda}\right) \textasciitilde = 1$
	- V = $$\dfrac{I_0\ L\ \cos(\theta)\ e^{j\omega(t - r/c)}}{4\pi \epsilon_0 C} \left( \dfrac{1}{r} + \dfrac{c}{j\omega^2} \dfrac{1}{r^2}\right)$$
## 1.1.B EM waves are generated by a conductor
1. Fundamental Principle:
	- static charge -> electrostatic field
	- steady current -> magnetic field
	- accelerating/decelerating charge -> changing electric and magnetic field that couple and propagate as EM waves
2. Mechanism in a conductor
	1. Driving with AC voltage
		- AC creates time-varying potential difference
		- this drives electrons back and forth -> time varying current I(t)
		- for a dipole antenna, charges accumulate at ends: +q, at one end, -q at the time other, reversing each half cycle
	2. creation of time varying field
		- changing current -> produces changing magnetic field (Ampere-Maxwell law)
		- curl of B = u0 J + u0 e0 $\delta$/$\delta$t E
		- changing charge distribution  -> produces changing electric field
	3. coupling and radiation
		1. changing b induces E (faraday's law)
		2. changing E induces B (maxwell's displacement current)
		3. this mutual induction sustains propagation away from the ocnductor.
3. Physical Picture of radiation
	- near the conductor: fields are reactive
		- energy oscillates between electric and magnetic
		- stored near antenna
	- at distances ~ $\lambda$ and beyond: fields decouple from source and propagate freely as transverse EM waves
	- transition zone: Near-field (Fresnel) to far-field (Fraunhofer).
# 1.2 Intro to Antenna
- Definition:
	- specialized transducer that converts electrical energy into EM waves (transmitting mode) and/or converts EM waves into electrical energy (receiving mode)
	- serves as an interface between guided waves (in transmission lines) and free-space radiation
- Condition for radiation from a conductor
	1. Essential condition: Time-varying current
	2. unbalanced/asymmetric charge distribution
		- a straight wire with uniform alternating current does not radiate efficiently
			- if it is electrically small and symmetric
		- radiation requires charge separation -> time-varying dipole moment
			- dp/dt =/= 0.
			- dipole antenna has +q at one end, -q at other
				- but they must be oscillating.
	3. geometric configuration and electrical size
		- conductor length relative to wavelength
		- electrical small (L << $\lambda$): Poor radiation
		- resonant length (L ~ $\lambda$/2, $\lambda$/4): efficient radiation
		- electrically large: can support travelling waves -> radiation pattern with lobes.
		- current distribution matters:
			- radiation occurs from curved path, discontinuities, or terminations where current changes mag/phase
			- straight wire: radiates if length is comparable to $\lambda$, and a current has non-uniform phase distribution.
	4. discontinuity/impedance mismatch
		- any discontinuity (bend, gap, termination) causes reflection of currents -> acceleration of charge -> radiation
		- example: monopole against ground plane -> discontinuity at feed point.
# 1.3 Antenna Theorems
## 3.A Reciprocity
- in linear or bilateral system,
	- the ratio of voltage V applied between any two terminals to the current I measured in any terminal is same as the ratio of
		- V to I obtained by interchanging the positions of
			- voltage source and ammeter for current measurement.

- V1 = Z11  I1 + Z12 I2
- V2 = Z21 I1 + Z22 I2
- Z12 = Z21
- Z12' = Z21'
- Y12 = Y21
- Y12' = Y21'

## 3.B Superposition
- the field intensity at a point due to the number of transmitting antenna is equal to the vector sum of field intensities at that point
	- due to each of the antenna
- figure:
  ![[Pasted image 20260126200744.png | 400]]
- applicable to linear system
- why it works?
	- I = V/R
	- due to multiple voltage, we get V1/R1 + V2/R2 + V3/R3
	- where all Ri are of the same load (produced by the receiving antenna)
	- so, we have I = (V1 + V2 + V3)/R
	- so we can say I proportional to sum of V  
## 3.C Thevenin
- antenna can be simplified by having simple generating voltage, and the impedances that it sees in the input side, and also the load side.
- an antenna system can be resolved into its equivalent thevenin's circuit
	- where:
	- Rl = loss resistance
	- Rr = Radiation resistance
	- Xa = Antenna reactance
	- Vg = voltage of generator
	- rg = resistance of generator
	- xr = reactance of generator

## 3.D Maximum Power Transfer Theorem
- simplify the thevenin circuit to have: Voltage (V), and input impedance Zin = Rin + j Xin
- have the load impedance be conjugate of the input impedance
	- such that Z L = Zin * = Rin - j Xin
- here, since Zin and Z l are in series, the Xin parts cancel out
- remaining imepdances in the ckt are equal Rin's.
- and maximum power transferred is:
	- Pmax = $\dfrac{V^2}{4R_{in}}$

## 3.E Compensation Theorem
- an antenna can be replaced by a generator with zero internal impedance
	- whose generated voltage at every instant is equal to the instantaneous potential difference
	- that exists across the antenna.
