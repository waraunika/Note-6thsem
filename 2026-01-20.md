# Antenna
## Yagi-Uda Antenna
### Main features
- name and honored to japanese engineers H. Yagi & S. Uda
- invented in 1928
- parasitic array antenna
- end-fire radiation: unidirectional type
- in VHF and UHF bands
- frequency range: 30 MHz - 3 GHz
- low cost, low profile
- relatively high gain
- dipole used in yagi-uda antenna as a driven element or feeder
- effective length of dipole is about 0.48 $\lambda$c
- length longer than driven element called reflector
- reflector behaves as inductive reactance
- shorter lengths are dipole are called directors
- parasitic elements are reflector and directors
- radiation produce push-and-pull effects
- forming a travelling wave structure at desired frequency, f$_c$
- feed impedance, Z$_{in}$ = 72 (1 + $\dfrac{d_1}{d_2}$)$^2$
	- if d1 =d2, Zin = 288 $\Omega$
- the induced current distribution in each element maintains and produces phase velocity of the traveling wave
- directivity (D) = 3.28N, where N is no. of elements
- D is significant when N is small
- no. of directors upto 6 to 12
- array length on the order of 6$\lambda$ of a typical antenna
- overall gain on the order of 14.8 - 17.3 dBi 
- applications mainly for TV reception
- main wave: direct wave, LSO communications
- TX mode: AM, FM Transmission
- Polarization: Linear (Horizontal)

## Log Periodic Antenna
### Features
- logarithmic antenna
- its input impedance is a function of logarithm of frequency
- Zin = f (log(f2) - log(f1))
- combination of number of different dipoles
- broadband antenna
- end-fire radiation pattern
- operating frequency ratio 4:1
	- i.e. fmax = 4 fmin
	- coverage range vhf 54 MHz to 216 MHz
- channel ratio is 10:1 (i.e. channels upto 10)
- application of frequency band: VHF and UHF
- main wave: space or direct wave
- secondary wave: ground reflected wave
- thus fading may occur
- polarization: linear (horizontal)
- beam direction: longer to shorter
- each element can be driven element
- antenna radiation can be bidirectional
	- if longest dipole behaves as a driven element
- shortest elements side is fed with TX line
- succeeding elements acquiring  acquire both the conduction and the induced currents
### Applications
used for HF communications
used for particular sort of tv
