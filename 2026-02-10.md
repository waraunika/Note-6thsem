# Propagation and Antenna
## Formula
1. $$ G = \eta \left( \dfrac{\pi\ D}{\lambda} \right)$$
2. $$ L_{fg} = 22 + 20\log \left( \dfrac{R}{\lambda} \right)$$
3. Short range (in km, R$_E$ = 6378 km, h = 35,786 km) -> $$ R = \sqrt{1 + 0.42\ (1-\cos(\theta))}\ \cdot\ h$$ 
4. $$ P_r = P_t G_t G_r \left( \dfrac{\lambda}{4\pi R} \right)^2$$
5. $$ R = \sqrt{1 + 0.42\ (1-\cos(\theta))}\ \cdot\ h$$
6. For Broad band, wide band and ultrawide band
$$FBW = \dfrac{2 (f_{max} - f_{min})}{f_{max} + f_{min}} \times 100\%$$
## Ground wave
- skip distance minimized using ground wave
- coverage greater for lower frequency
- low can cover about 1000 km
- at MF, it may extend as far as 100 miles
- protection: Short circuits
- affected by electric discharge
- easy path: wet, humid better than dry
- for marine (ship) communications: 10 ~ 110 kHz
- time & Frequency Mangt: 16 kHz$_{UK}$, 17.8 kHz$_{US}$
- radiation pattern: omnidirectional
- MW propagation: 535 kHz - 1625 kHz
- Loss of energy: absorptions
- tends to follow the curvature of the earth
- enables coverage beyond the horizon
- radio horizon is 4/3 times higher than optical
- beyond the horizon the direct and reflected waves are blocked by the curvature of the earth
- signal propagated due to diffracted surface wave
- thus the surface wave is commonly called ground wave propagation
- degree of attenuation is dependent upon a verity of factors
	- frequency of the radio signal
	- losses rise with increasing frequency
- impracticable above 3 MHz (SW)
- typically a signal at 3.0 MHz will suffer an attenuation that may be in the region of 20 to 60 dB

- propagation method: diffraction
- Rx power depends on:
	- Tx Power
	- frequency
	- surface Nature
	- season wise
- signal reception suffered by
	- D/E Layer's absorption
	- Diurnally (Day time wise)
	- seasonally
	- annually (11 yrs sun cycle)
	- fading effect
## Ground Reflected Wave
- transmission will be reflected by a number of objects
	- including the earth's surface
	- any hills
	- large buildings
	- large solid structures
## Duct Propagation
- radio duct or just ducting
- tropospheric ducting
- atmospheric duct
- temperature inversion
- super refection
- EM propagation within Tropospheric layer
- duct propagation for VHF and UHF frequencies
- affect propagation in 50 MHz to 450 MHz
- propagation distance few hundred to ~ 2000 km
- it usually happened 30-50 m above ground
- usually decrease in temperature of 6.5$^{0}$/Km as h $\uparrow$
- but it is sometimes opposite under certain weather condition, i.e. temperature inversion
- as air density $\downarrow$ refractive index $\uparrow$ with increasing height above the ground
- change in refractive index is linear and gradual
- guides the radio waves along the curvature of the earth
- thereby allowing the spreading of wave fronts
- under certain atmospheric conditions produce a layer of air in troposphere
- will be at higher temperature than the layers of air above and below it
- layer of warm air is trapped above cooled air, often over teh surface of water
- which has less signal loss than cooler layers above and below it
- which results in
## space wave
- aka direct wave
- f above 30 MHz
- band VHF, UHF, SHF, and UHF
- polarization: LP and CP
- Tx and Rx distance: 30 - 70 km ~ 36,000 km$_{GEO}$
- skip distance D = 3.671 ( $\sqrt{h_t} + \sqrt{h_r}$ ) km
- radio horizon: 4/3 > optical horizon
- communication: LOS
- u-wave link > 100 km not economical
- transmission mode: am, fm, pm
- transmission power < 1km
- radiation: unidirection
- bandwidth: wide, broad and ultrawide
- signal suffered when reception:
	- atmospheric changes
	- ionospheric changes
	- fading
- distance between Tx and Rx (d) = 1.41 ( $\sqrt{h_t} + \sqrt{h_r}$ ) miles
- fading may occur
- field reduction increases as it travels
- space wave is limited due to curvature of the earth
- propagation method: diffraction
- effect of imperfect earth
	- attenuation and attenuation distortion (?)
	- free space loss
	- noise
	- atompsheric absorption
	- multipath
