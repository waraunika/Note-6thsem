# Signal (S)
- Physical Phenomena 
- Conveys / Carries some info
- Fxn of 1(+) indep var
	- Time
	- Amp
	- Phase
	- Freq
- Amp : Val of signal at any specified val of indep var
- Waveform : Sketch / Plot of amp of signal as fxn of indep var
## Classification
### No of Channel
1. 1 Channel
S gen by 1 src / sensor

2. Multichannel
S gen by multiple src / sensor
Eg ECG record at 8 diff place = 8-channel signal

3. 1D Channel
S which is fxn of 1 indep var
x1(t) = 0.7t

4. Multidim
Fxn of 2(+) indep var
x1(t) = 0.6p + 1.1q
Photo : Intensity & Brightness
Video : Time Intensity Brightness

5. Analog / Continuous
S defined cont for any val of indep var
Cont Time Signal : x(t)
	Defined for every instant of indep var T & mag is cont in specified T range

6. Discrete 
S defined for discrete intervals of indep var
Discrete Time Signal 
	Indep var T "t" uniformly dif into discrete intervals of T
	Each interval --> Denoted by int n

- Digital Signal
	- Quantized & Coded version of DTS
	- Val of signal for every discrete time "n" 
		- Repr in binary code
		- Standard size of binary is chosen
		- m bit repr -> 2 quantization levels
