- use spherical coordinate system
- let the current passing through the conductor be I 
	- then I = I$_0$ e$^{j\omega t}$ 
	- and I = $\dfrac{dq}{dt}$
- instantaneous propagation, due to the effect of lorentz force (current)
	- $$\left[ I \right] = I_0\ \cdot\ e^{j\omega \left[t - \dfrac{r}{c} \right]}$$
	- also called retarded current or propagation current.
	- here, r = distance from center of dipole
	- c = speed of light
	- r/c  = retarded time,
		- this results in phase retardation, $\omega \frac{r}{c}$
		- which is equal to:
			- $2\pi f \frac{r}{c}$
			- $360^0 f \frac{r}{c}$
			- $360^0 \frac{1}{T} \frac{r}{c}$
- the retarded vector potential of the electric current,
	- $$A_z = \dfrac{\micro_0}{4\pi} \int_{-\frac{l}{2}}^{\frac{l}{2}} \dfrac{[I]}{s} dz $$
