- No central disaster communication
    

## 5. No Recovery Plan

- Over 1 month of "efforts" with Oracle

# 13. Conclusion

The GIDC data loss incident of Falgun 2079 (March 2023) represents **one of the worst cases of government IT infrastructure failure in Nepal's history**. Despite being specifically established to secure government data, the National Information Technology Center (NITC) failed at its core mandate due to:

1. **No backup system** - Basic data center requirement ignored
    
2. **Ignored warnings** - Auditor General's report dismissed
    
3. **Poor crisis management** - Over 1 month with no solution
    
4. **No accountability** - No official held responsible
    
5. **Blame culture** - Shifting responsibility to victim agencies
    

The **biggest victim** is the **Public Service Commission**, which lost application data of approximately **85,000 candidates** who had applied for Section Officer, Nayab Subba, and Health Service positions. These candidates now face **1.5-2 months delay** in their examinations and must go through the hassle of **re-applying** despite having already completed the process once.

**Most critically**, the full extent of the damage **remains unknown**, and there is **no guarantee** that such an incident won't happen again. Nepal's national data security stands at a critical juncture, and without **systemic reform, accountability, and massive investment in backup infrastructure**, more such disasters are inevitable.
