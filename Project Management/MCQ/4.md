# 11. Observations & Analysis

## Positive Developments

1. **Two tunnels** (Dharke and Lendanda) have achieved **breakthrough** - major milestone
    
2. **Mahadevtar tunnel** progressing well - 64% and 74% completed
    
3. **85 bridges** under contract and construction
    
4. **Land acquisition completed** for 24.8-70.977 km section

4. **Chandraam Bhir tunnel** - less than 15% progress
    
5. **Only 5 km** of road blacktopped - extremely low for project of this scale
    
6. **4 bridges** cannot even start due to land issues
    
7. **No deadline** mentioned for completing pending land acquisition

# 13. Conclusion

The **Kathmandu-Tarai-Madhesh Fast Track Expressway** project shows **mixed progress**:

✅ **Tunnels**: Two major tunnels completed (breakthrough), Mahadevtar tunnel progressing well  
✅ **Bridges**: Majority under construction, 13 completed  
✅ **Land**: Large section (24.8-70.977 km) cleared and under construction

❌ **LAND ACQUISITION**: **SERIOUS CRISIS** - Political and administrative failure to resolve disputes  
❌ **Bridges**: 4 bridges cannot start due to land issues  
❌ **Tunnels**: New tunnels have **negligible progress** (7-8 meters only)  
❌ **Road**: Only 5 km blacktopped - extremely slow  
❌ **Project deadline**: December 2024 - **virtually impossible to meet**

The project, a **National Pride Project**, is facing its biggest challenge not from technical difficulties or contractor performance, but from **land acquisition disputes** that political and administrative authorities have **failed to resolve**. Until this fundamental issue is addressed, the Fast Track will remain stuck in the slow lane.

**Total pending land acquisition**: Approximately **527 Ropani** across three districts (Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Makwanpur)  
**Most critical**: Khokana-Budhamati area with **316 Ropani** pending (valuation done but compensation not distributed + valuation not done)
