# 4. Key Legal Issues

## 1. Conflict of Interest - Initial Disqualification

- **Army's position**: Two Chinese bidders had common stakeholder (CCB Financial)
    
- This constituted **conflict of interest** under procurement laws
    
- CFHEC rightly disqualified from technical evaluation
    

## 2. Review Committee's Authority

- **Petitioner's argument**:
    
    - Review Committee **exceeded its jurisdiction**
        
    - Evidence of share transfer submitted **AFTER** technical bid opening
        
    - Such late submission should NOT be accepted
        
    - Committee has no authority to consider evidence presented later
        

## 3. Procedural Irregularity

- **Army's action**:
    
    - Sent contract invitation letter to CFHEC on **same day** court ordered document submission
        
    - Apparent disrespect to judicial process
        
    - Acted while writ petition was under consideration
        

## 4. Malafide Intent Allegation

- **Petitioner's claim**:
    
    - Review Committee's decision was **not lawful** but **malafide**
        
    - Unfair reinstatement of Chinese company
        
    - Process designed to favor specific bidder
        

## 5. Timing of Evidence

- **Core question**: Can a bidder submit new evidence of share transfer **after** technical bids are opened?
    
- Petitioner: No, this violates procurement transparency
    
- Respondent: Committee has review powers
    

---

# 5. Petitioner's Arguments (Afcons Infrastructure Ltd.)

1. **Conflict of interest was real** at time of technical bid submission
    
2. **Evidence submitted late** (September 6 letter) should not be considered
    
3. **Public Procurement Review Committee** lacks authority to accept post-bid evidence
    
4. Committee's decision to reinstate CFHEC is **illegal and malafide**
    
5. Army's compliance with Committee's directive was **against procurement law**
    
6. **Disqualified company** winning contract is **unnatural and suspicious**
    
7. Army acted in **bad faith** by sending contract invitation letter while case sub-judice
    
8. **Interim order necessary** to prevent irreversible contract signing
    

---

# 6. Respondent's Position (Nepal Army)

1. **Compliance**: Army only followed Public Procurement Review Committee's directive
    
2. **Legal obligation**: Committee's order binding on implementing agency
    
3. **Lowest bidder**: CFHEC is legitimately the lowest bidder after reinstatement
    
4. **Due process**: Financial bid opened only after Committee's clearance
    
5. **Project deadline**: December 2024 completion target already challenging
    
6. **Further delays**: Court case will push deadline further
    
7. **Admission**: Army had admitted in February 2022 that completing by December 2024 would be challenging

# 15. Conclusion

The **Kathmandu-Tarai-Madhesh Fast Track Package 6 contract dispute** represents a classic conflict between:

1. **Procurement law principles** (transparency, fair competition, conflict of interest)
    
2. **Project implementation urgency** (national pride project, deadline pressure)
    
3. **Geopolitical dimensions** (Chinese contractor vs Indian contractor)
    
4. **Institutional jurisdiction** (Review Committee's powers vs Army's evaluation)
    
5. **Judicial oversight** (Supreme Court's role in public procurement)
    

The Supreme Court's **interim order** has temporarily halted the contract award to China First Highway Engineering Co., preserving the status quo until the full merits of the case can be heard.

The core legal question—**whether a bidder can cure a conflict of interest defect by submitting new evidence after technical bid opening**—will have far-reaching implications for Nepal's public procurement system regardless of how the court finally rules.

For the **85,000+ candidates** waiting for PSC exams? No, that's different case. For this project, the **Nepali public** waits for their expressway, while the **Indian and Chinese companies** wait for the court's verdict.

**The Fast Track remains stuck in the slow lane of litigation.**
