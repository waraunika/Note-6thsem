							MEMORANDUM

							    MEMO
To : Head of Department / Acedemic Comittee
From : Rejina
Date : January 6, 20260
Subject : Report on Recently Organized Academic Event and Observed Low Student Participation

This memo presents a brief report on the recently organized academic event, focusing on its overall conduct, outcomes, and the issue of low student participation observed during the programme.

The academic event was successfully conducted as scheduled and achieved its intended academic objectives in terms of content delivery and scholarly engagement. The programme features relevant themes, knowledgeable resource persons, and well-structured sessions that contributed meaningfully to academic discourse. Faculty members and invited participants actively engaged in discussions, making the event academically enriching and professionally relevant.

However, despite the academic strength of the programme, student participation was notably lower than expected. Attendance did not reflect the potential

In conclusion, while the academic event was well-organized and intellectually valuable, addressing the issue of student participation is essential to maximize its educational impact. Strategic planning and student-centered approaches can enhance attendance and ensure more inclusive academic engagement in future programmes
